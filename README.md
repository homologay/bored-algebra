# Bored Algebra

YAML (yet another math library)

### What this is

* incomplete, unpolished
* a library
* focused on generics and abstractions

### What this isn't

* an app
* focused on performance
* replacing nalgebra

## How 2 Use

Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/maxinebeckie/bored-algebra.git
```
Or, if you're into ssh:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:maxinebeckie/bored-algebra.git
```
## Features

* Polynomial arithmetic over a ring (mostly works, still smoothing some edges)
* Integers mod n
* Finite fields (in progress)
* Prime generation (works, but is super inefficient)
* Irreducible polynomial generation (todo)
