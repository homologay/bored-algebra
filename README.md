# Bored Algebra

YAML (yet another math library)

### What this is

* incomplete, unpolished
* a library
* focused on generics and abstractions

### What this isn't

* on crates.io (yet)
* focused on performance
* replacing nalgebra

## How 2 Use

Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/maxinebeckie/bored-algebra.git
```
```sh
git clone git@github.com:maxinebeckie/bored-algebra.git
```
## Features

* Polynomial arithmetic over a ring (in progress - note this gives us multivariable polynomials for free!)
* Integers mod n
* Finite fields (ie, GF(p, q). q > 1 is in progress)
* Iterators over special polynomials: irreducible, cyclotomic, .. (todo)
* Iterators over primes in a ring (todo)
* Localization of a ring (todo)
