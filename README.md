## bored-algebra

A rust library for commutative algebra, not much here yet. Some motivating questions for the library: 

- is a given high-degree polynomial over Z/2 irreducible?
- what is the Grobner basis for the ideal generated by a given list of polynomials in (Z/7)\[X1, X2, ..., X8\]?
- given an element r and a multiplicative subset S of a finite ring R, is r a unit in the localization of R at S?
- what are the primes in the group ring (Z/7789)\[S_5040\]?

I want to learn rust's type system in more depth and see how well it works for recursive types and math abstractions. It seems like a weird mishmash so far. I find that the more I learn about rust's type system, the more I hate it. It's better than C's, for sure, but it makes my head hurt. Hopefully that will lead to understanding in the long term, but I've been tempted to abandon this and try learning Haskell or Agda instead many times. 

There are lots of far-off ideas for where this could go. Some are:

- homology of simplicial complexes, finite groups, spectral sequence computations
- approximation-based computations in infinite structures like Laurent series, polynomials in countably many variables
- use of graphics libraries to plot intersections of surfaces, other algebraic geometry applications
- category-theoretic approaches, abelian categories

These are left as exercises for the reader ;3

## How to view the documentation

Build with the following flags, so the KaTeX renders properly.
```sh
RUSTDOCFLAGS="--html-in-header src/katex-header.html" cargo doc --no-deps --open
```
This is from the crate `rustdoc-katex-demo`.
