# Bored Algebra

Library for constructions on rings, with a focus on iterators and finite fields.

## How 2 Use

1. Don't, yet. This project is still in early stages.

2. Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/maxinebeckie/bored-algebra.git
```
```sh
git clone git@github.com:maxinebeckie/bored-algebra.git
```
## Features

* Polynomial arithmetic over a ring (in progress)
* Integers mod n (works, but more methods are todo)
* Quotient rings (todo)
* Finite fields (ie, GF(p, q). q > 1 is todo)
* Iterators over special polynomials: irreducible, cyclotomic, .. (todo)
* Iterators over primes in a ring (todo)
* Localization of a ring (todo)
